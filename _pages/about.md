I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/). My research focuses on the intersection of behavioural and public economics. In particular, I study the role of social preferences in taxation and how competition among prosocial actors can affect the decentralized provision of public goods. My broader interests include contract theory and its applications. You can find my CV [here](https://munozsobrado.github.io/files/CV_MunozSobrado.pdf).

<strong>Holier than thou: competition among charitable organisations. Theory and evidence from the U.S</strong> <br>

Charities actively engage in costly fundraising to collect the proceeds necessary to fund their activities. I build a model in which charities compete for donations through informative advertising and may differ in terms of quality in a setting with atomistic donors that value efficient charities heterogeneously. In equilibrium, advertising expenditures are excessive with respect to a welfare-maximising benchmark. Moreover, this inefficiency is increasing in the amount of funds available in the market. This result yields three predictions: (i) increases in the deductibility rate of charitable donations should correlate positively with measures of intensity of competition between charities, (ii) equilibrium quality provision may be affected by such deductibility rate, (iii) normative estimates of the optimal deductibility rate that do not take into account the effect of competition need to be adjusted downwards. I use data from the IRS, Kantar Media and Charity Navigator to estimate a structural model of competition to assess (i) and (ii) and provide appropriate estimates on (iii) for the US.

<strong>Taxing moral agents</strong>

Experimental and empirical findings suggest that non-pecuniary motivations play a significant role as determinants of taxpayersâ€™ decisions to comply with the tax authority and shape their perceptions and assessment of the tax code. By contrast, the canonical optimal income taxation model focuses on material sanctions as the primary motive for compliance. This paper shows how taxpayers equipped with evolutionary Kantian preferences can account for both these non-pecuniary and material motivations. It builds a general model of income taxation in the presence of a public good, which agents value morally, and solves for the optimal linear and non-linear taxation problems.

<strong>Resource allocation in the presence of moral hazard and endogenous adverse selection</strong><br>
(with [Alae Baha [Oxford]](https://sites.google.com/view/alae-baha/accueil))

    <p>
A principal wants to develop a new product by delegating its production to an agent. Production is dichotomic and stochastic. The agent allocates resources between a task that yields direct production and a task that increases his productivity. Increasing productivity makes effort more costly. We show that when the resource allocation is non-observable, the agent's final productivity in the contract proposed by the principal is lower than the optimal one. In this setting, raising bonuses encourages both effort and increases in productivity, as a result, compared to a benchmark in which the allocation is observable, the principal has incentives to reduce the bonus due to the agent being less productive and incentives to increase the bonus to encourage him to increase his productivity. The main result of our paper shows that, when both the initial productivity and the cost of increasing productivity are small, this leads to higher bonuses than the full observability benchmark.
