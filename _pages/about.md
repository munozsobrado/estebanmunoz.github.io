I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/). My research focuses on the intersection of behavioural and public economics. In particular, I study the role of social preferences in taxation and how competition among prosocial actors can affect the decentralized provision of public goods. My broader interests include contract theory and its applications. You can find my CV [here](https://munozsobrado.github.io/files/CV_MunozSobrado.pdf).

<strong>Competing for Donations: The Role of Tax Deductibility in the U.S. Charitable Sector.</strong> <br>

    <p>
Charitable organizations are vital for funding public goods, but they often rely on costly fundraising efforts to fund their activities. This paper argues that fundraising through advertising turns charities into de facto competitors for funds in an otherwise rivalrous environment.  I build a model where charities use informative advertising to attract individual donors. Competition leads to inefficient fundraising as charities incur excessive advertising costs, and the inefficiency increases as available funds increase. This paper highlights the implications of increased deductibility rates for charitable donations, such as intensified competition and potential impact on the quality of services provided by charities. I then use data from the IRS, Kantar Media, and Charity Navigator to estimate the model and find that increasing the deductibility rate leads to considerable increases in competition between charities. These findings underscore the need to consider trade-offs associated with tax incentives for charitable giving and consider competitive effects when designing policy aimed at promoting an impactful charitable sector.

    <p>
Experimental and empirical findings suggest that non-pecuniary motivations play a significant role as determinants of taxpayersâ€™ decisions to comply with the tax authority and shape their perceptions and assessment of the tax code. By contrast, the canonical optimal income taxation model focuses on material sanctions as the primary motive for compliance. This paper shows how taxpayers equipped with evolutionary Kantian preferences can account for both these non-pecuniary and material motivations. It builds a general model of income taxation in the presence of a public good, which agents value morally, and solves for the optimal linear and non-linear taxation problems.

<strong>Resource allocation in the presence of moral hazard and endogenous adverse selection</strong><br>

    <p>
A principal wants to develop a new product by delegating its production to an agent. Production is dichotomic and stochastic. The agent allocates resources between a task that yields direct production and a task that increases his productivity. Increasing productivity makes effort more costly. We show that when the resource allocation is non-observable, the agent's final productivity in the contract proposed by the principal is lower than the optimal one. In this setting, raising bonuses encourages both effort and increases in productivity, as a result, compared to a benchmark in which the allocation is observable, the principal has incentives to reduce the bonus due to the agent being less productive and incentives to increase the bonus to encourage him to increase his productivity. The main result of our paper shows that, when both the initial productivity and the cost of increasing productivity are small, this leads to higher bonuses than the full observability benchmark.
